# Mobile Application - Software Architecture + Engineering

## Prenote
Delivery faces challenges as the env of a mobile app/ device is ever changing, and it is changing fast. <br>
Modules first inception was back in 2010. <br>
Many changes since then to both android and IOS. <br>
This modue <b>FOCUS = andrid.</b> <br>
Most of what is learnt is applicable to IOS too.

## Tools and languages used
Eclipse / Java / Android Tool Plugins / XML View Layouts (2010-2016)<br>
Android Studio / Java / XML View Layouts (2017-2021)<br>
Android Studio / Kotlin / XML View Layouts (2022)<br>
<b>Android Studio / Kotlin / JetPack Compose (2023-present) </b><br>

## Last two deliveries
Shifted to JetPack Compose + @Composable (as per 'good practice' put forward by google and android) <br>
2017 onw: API docs shifted from being java focused... to <b>Kotlin.</b> <br>
XML way of building UI's have been replaced on the docs with <b>Jetpack Compose.</b> <br>
Software implementation of he module will be based on this.

## Additional
This is more than just software implementation. <br>
Design challenges. <i>To optimise and run well on resource constrained devices.</i> <br>
Jetpack Compose risen due to challanges of state management on mobile devices (running mult apps in varying states) <br>
... <br>
Classroom sessions focus on this. <br>
<i>Content shown in both formats... Compose and XML</i> <br>
Examples are there to highlight the challenges faced by devs. <br>
Understanding Jetpack Compose means understanding why Kotin Compiler Plugin has been made... <br>
